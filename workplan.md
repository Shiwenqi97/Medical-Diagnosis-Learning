### Experiments

1. David Sontag's ICD9 embeddings. Take sum, avg, (min, max) or embeddings per encounter, then feed into LSTM, BiLSTM
2. Same as one with attention
3. Same as 1. + sum/avg of pubmed embeddings of each note
4. Same as 3. with attention

5. Exploring better representations notes
  - Multiple embeddings per notes
  - Learning from convolutions (multiple filters to generate a sequence)
6. Maybe try grounding?

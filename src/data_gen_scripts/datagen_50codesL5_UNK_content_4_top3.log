Large, necrotic left breast mass with associated left\naxillary lymphadenopathy, as described above. Findings are\nhighly suspicious for a primary breast carcinoma.\n2. Diffuse metastatic disease involving the liver and lungs.\n3. Multiple osseous metastases as described above, including a\nlarge soft tissue mass involving the L2 through L5 posterior\nelements, with encroachment on the spinal canal. There is\ngreater than 50% effacement of the canal at the L3 level.\n4. Additional areas of heterogeneity are noted throughout the\nthoracic spine. These findings are better evaluated on the\ncomparison MR of the thoracic spine, which does demonstrate\nevidence of metastatic disease throughout these levels.\n.\nECG ([**11-27**]): Normal sinus rhythm. RSR' pattern in leads V1-V2\nwith a QRS duration of 82 milliseconds. Consider left atrial\nabnormality. Within normal limits.

Compared to CXRAY on [**11-29**], right\nmid and lower lung zone opacity has nearly resolved consistent\nwith resolved asymmetric pulmonary edema. There is no new focal\nconsolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.\n.\nCXR ([**12-4**]): Exam to evaluate ETT placement, interval change\nsince admission. The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes are\nin\nunchanged position.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is\nunchanged. The remainder of the examination is unchanged without\nan acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.\n.\nUrine culture ([**12-7**]): Repeat urine culture after 9 days on\nCiprofloxacin for complicated UTI, culture shows no growth.\n.\nDischarge Results:\n.\n[**2100-12-10**] 05:15AM BLOOD WBC-21.3* RBC-3.88* Hgb-11.7* Hct-35.1*\nMCV-91 MCH-30.0 MCHC-33.2 RDW-15.0 Plt Ct-403\n[**2100-12-10**] 05:15AM BLOOD Glucose-112* UreaN-19 Creat-0.4 Na-135\nK-4.5 Cl-102 HCO3-25 AnGap-13\n[**2100-12-10**] 05:15AM BLOOD Calcium-10.6* Phos-2.4* Mg-2.1\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n46 year-old female with large necrotic left breast mass and\nlumbar mass with concern for primary breast cancer with lumbar\nmets.\n.\n1. Necrotic Breast Mass and Lumbar Mass: Patient reported\nappearance of left breast mass approximately six months prior to\npresentation with development of low back pain approximately\nfour months later (two months prior to presentation). Patient's\nlast mammogram was seven years ago with little contact with the\nmedical community in the interim. Patient's presenting complaint\nwas low back pain. Examination revealed a large necrotic left\nbreast mass with left axillary lymphadenopathy, a large midline\nlumbar mass and some proximal lower extremity weakness, left\ngreater than right, but no other significant neurological\ndeficits. Spine MRI revealed bony metastasis in T4, T5 and T6\nvertebral bodies as well as in T10 vertebra but no pathologic\nfracture, epidural mass or spinal cord compression. CT torso\nrevealed diffusely metastatic disease involving the liver and\nlungs, thoracic spine metastases as reported in the MRI\nfindings, as well as multiple other osseous metastases including\na large soft tissue mass involving the posterior elements of L2\nto L5 and greater than 50% effacement of the spinal canal. A\nleft breast core needle biopsy revealed a grade 3 invasive\nductal carcinoma that was ER/PR +. Radiation oncology and\nMedical Oncology were contact[**Name (NI) **] the evening of admission.\nSteroids were initiated the night of admission to prevent\nadvancement of the spinal disease. The patient was given a TLSO\nbrace for comfort. Lupron was given for ovarian suppression once\nreceptor studies were reported. Patient went to the OR on [**12-2**]\nfor spinal stabilization and on [**12-3**] for spinal mass debulking.\nThe patient initially had a Wound vac in place but was removed\nseveral days prior to dishcarge. At discharge the wound appeared\nto be healing well. The patient was discharged to a\nrehabilitation facility to recover from her surgery prior to\ninitiation of chemotherapy and radiation.\n.\n2. Presumed Pyelonephritis: Patient presented to urgent care\nclinic one week prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 18**] for symptoms\nconsistent with cystitis. Patient was prescribed Bactrim but\nonly completed a partial course. On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] the\npatient reported recent fevers to 101.5F, shaking chills,\nnausea, and flank pain (which was impossible to differentiate\nfrom pain due to her metastatic disease). Patient had\nleukocytosis on presentation. Blood cultures were taken and were\nnegative. Repeat UA and urine culture were negative. Despite the\nnegative urine studies, the patient was started on Ciprofloxacin\nIV (Ceftriaxone was not given as patient reported penicillin\nallergy) for a total of a 10-day course as clinical suspicion\nfor possible pyelonephritis was sufficiently high. The patient\nwas transitioned to Ciprofloxacin PO after clinical improvement\nwas observed for approximately 48 hours. The patient ultimately\ncompleted 9 days of antibiotics. One dose was missed as the\npatient was moved between services. A repeat urinalysis was\nperformed and showed no evidence of active infection so no\nfurther antibiotics were given.\n.\n3. Hypercalcemia: Serum Ca 15.2 on admission. Bony metastases\nwere deemed the most likely etiology. Normal saline was started\nat 250 cc/hr to maintain a urine output of 100-150 cc/hr.\nCalcitonin and Pamidronate were given for osteoclast inhibition.\nSerum Ca subsequently decreased to between 9 and 10. Lasix were\ngiven when the patient subsequently developed hypoxia with CXR\nevidence of pulmonary edema. The patient's hypoxia resolved. The\npatient continued to receive IVF as needed with Lasix to prevent\nrecurrence of volume overload. At discharge, the patient's\ncorrected calcium was approximately 10.8. The Oncology service\nstated that they would give the patient her next dose of\nPamidronate in clinic at her appointment on [**12-22**].\n.\n4. Anemia: Hematocrit on admission was 35.9 with an unknown\nbaseline. Anemia of chronic disease (AICD) was considered the\nmost likely etiology given the patient's underlying disease\nprocess. Reticulocyte count 2.2 with reticulocyte index of 0.95,\nindicating an [**Last Name 88383**] problem consistent with her\ninflammatory state. DIC labs indicated no DIC with a fibrinogen\nof 485 and FDP of 0-10. Calculated TIBC was 229, ferritin was\n879, and transferrin was 176, all consistent with anemia of\nchronic disease. The patient did ultimately require transfusion\nof 5 units of packed red blood cells for surgery-related losses.\nAfter transfer back to the medicine floor, the patient's\nhematocrit remained stable at approximately 35 throughout the\nremainder of her hospitalization.\n.\n5. Pain control: On admission, patient complained of significant\nback pain and sharp, shooting pain down her right leg with\nmovement. She was first treated with 2-4 mg IV Dilaudid, Q3 PRN.\nPatient still felt pain was substantial. On [**11-27**], pain\nmedication was changed to MS Contin 30 mg PO Q8H, with IV 1-2 mg\nDilaudid for breakthrough pain. On [**11-29**], morphine afternoon dose\nincreased to 45 mg TID. MS Contin was again increased on [**12-7**]\nto 60 mg PO Q8H, with breakthrough IV Dilaudid. On [**12-8**], the\npatient required 6 mg of IV Dilaudid for breakthrough pain. Her\nMS Contin was increased to 90 mg Q8H on [**12-9**].\n.\n6. Constipation: On admission, patient had not had a bowel\nmovement in approx 10 days. Likely etiology of patient's\nconstipation presumed to be her hypercalcemia. After\nhypercalcemia levels were corrected, patient was passing gas,\nbut still not moving bowels. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis\nshowed no evidence of compressive obstruction. The patient's\nbowel regimen was adjusted as needed and the patient received\nintermittent enemas for additional relief. As it seemed likely\nthat much of the patient's ongoing constipation was likely\nopioid-related the patient received one dose of\nMethylnaltrexone.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications:\n1.
